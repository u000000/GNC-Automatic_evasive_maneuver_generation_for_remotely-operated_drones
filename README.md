# Guidance Navigation & Control - Drone Defensive Movement

This project encompanses a simulation for a drone which uses eratic movements to avoid small caliber attacks. 
Additionally the drone can, on command, move out of its location drastically to avoid explosive rounds.

The goal of this simulation is to generate a platform for futher research in safety against drone attacks.
